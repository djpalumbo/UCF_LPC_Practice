1&2) Sample data

3) Biggest circle
4) Smallest circle

5&6) Same start and end points, but swapped; segments will be shorted for one but not the other (cw vs. ccw)

7) Biggest circle, going from start to middle, back to start, to end

8) Biggest circle, going from start to near middle, back to start, to end (which is still shorter than the arc)

9&10) Center at (-pi, -pi) radius=2, start to end is vertical. These cases are intended to make them get a negative value
   for the angle between start and end (for one of the two cases) in order to get a negative arc length

11) Same as previous, except there are 10 points inside the circle given, all of them the same exact point
   (which is valid by the specification)

12&13) Very tiny angle, cw and ccw

14) start over end vetically, ten intra-circle points that lie extremely close to (0,0)

15) circle has radius = pi, intra-circle segments create a path with vertical and horizonal lines

16) arc makes non-right, obtuse angle; intra-circle path is long and useless

17) intra-circle path goes directly to within 0.000001 of the end, then back to the start

18) the arc wins by 0.002

19) the intra-circle path wins by 0.002
