Test Cases
----------

1-3: Sample Input

4: A line graph which is already fully numbered (possible)

5: The same graph as previous, but no numbers provided (possible)

6: A fully connected graph with 3 nodes numbered (possible, just use other 2 numbers)

7: Same graph as previous, but only 2 nodes numbered (not possible)

8-11: A cycle with 4 nodes, 1 of which is numbered (possible)

12-13: A cycle with 5 nodes, 1 of which is numbered (the second node from either side of A) (possible)

14: A cycle of length 25, nothing numbered (not possible)

15: A cycle of length 26, nothing numbered (possible)

16: A line graph with a triangle at the beginning (not possible, might break backtracking)

17: A line graph with a triangle at the end (not possible, might break backtracking)

18: A binary tree using the nodes in order (possible), like this:
             A
       B            C 
   D      E      F      G
 H   I  J   K  L   M  N   O
P Q R ST U V WX Y Z

19: A graph forcing processing of subgraph isolated by numbered nodes (not possible)

20: Same as previous but subgraph possible to number this time.

21-40: Random graphs, all possible, increasing in size, nothing initially numbered.

41-60: Random graphs, all impossible, increasing in size, nothing initially numbered.

61-100: Random graphs, optionally some dungeons already numbered, increasing in size (could be possible or not)
