# UCF Local Programming Contest Practice

This repository contains programming problems from UCF's Local Programming Contests, all of which can be found [here](http://lpc.ucfprogrammingteam.org/index.php/past-contests/past-problem-sets).

# practicer.py
This script can be used to test one's programming skills. It selects a random problem from the set(s) of problems provided and begins a timer, which can be stopped by the user once the selected problem has been completed.

Note: Later, I may implement a code-checking feature to actually determine whether or not the solution that was submitted was correct.
